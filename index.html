            <h3>Ethics on Attorney Client Privilege</h2>
            <p>For this project, I decided to research ethics on attorney client privilege and ended up coming away with two cases that I went more in depth with, which this site will explain on.</p>

            <h2>What is "Attorney Client Privilege?"</h2>
            <p>Attorney Client Privliege is a rule that keeps communication and information between a personal and their lawyer confidential. So whatever is said to a lawyer in private cannot be disclosed to anyone unless granted permission by the client.</p>
            <h4>The Purpose?</h4>
            <p>The reason to have Attorney Client Privilege is for clients to be able to receive legal advice and feel safe being able to honest with their lawyers. It can be used to help not self-incriminate a person and discuss options for a person in legal situations.</p>
